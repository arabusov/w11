## 2022-08-03: tests with SimH V3.11-0 and 2.11BSD 447 (plus 453 patch)

### Background
The `MMR1` response after an MMU abort in an FPP instruction depends on the CPU.
On an 11/70, the registers reflect the state at abort and `MMR1` shows the
change. On a J11, the registers are unchanged, and `MMR1` shows zero.

SimH V3.11-0 used the J11 FPP MMU abort handling for _all_ CPU models.
So even when an 11/70 is modeled, the behavior is like a J11.

The 2.11BSD stack extension logic checks whether the `sp` is below the
current stack allocation, and only in that case, the stack is extended.
On a J11-based system that fails, that's why 2.11BSD up to #473 has a
workaround and shifts the `sp` down by 4 _if and only if_ a J11 was
probed at boot time. The pertinent code in `/usr/src/sys/pdp/trap.c` is
```
    osp = sp;
    if (kdj11)
        osp -= 4;
    if (backup(u.u_ar0) == 0)
        if (!(u.u_sigstk.ss_flags & SA_ONSTACK) && grow((u_int)osp))
            goto out;
    i = SIGSEGV;
```

That leads to two vulnerabilities:
- a `double` push of 8 bytes might fail on J11 systems, real or simulated,
- in a SimH 11/70, which probes as an 11/70 but behaves like a J11, any
  push from an FPP instruction might fail.

The first is a 2.11BSD issue, the second is a SimH issue.

The tests were run under `tcsh`, it gives "Segmentation fault" in case of
a problem. Under `sh` one gets "Memory fault".

### SimH in 11/94 mode
SimH pdp11 started with
```
set cpu 11/94
```
and 2.11BSD starts with
```
94Boot from xp(0,0,0) at 0176700
```
Extending the stack with `float` pushes is no problem until the stack segment
has grown to 020000 and memory is really exhausted:
```
./stktst f ' 1024'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177334 (0,  4,36); 177334 (0,  4,36);
  # stktst-I: after  sp 177334 (0,  4,36); 177334 (0,  4,36); 167334 (0, 68,36);
./stktst f '14263'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177334 (0,  4,36); 177334 (0,  4,36);
  # stktst-I: after  sp 177334 (0,  4,36); 177334 (0,  4,36); 020000 (6,127,64);
./stktst f '14264'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177334 (0,  4,36); 177334 (0,  4,36);
  # Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Extending with `double` pushes can fail depending on the alignment of the
`double`. If they are click aligned all is fine, the 4 byte offset in
2.11BSB ensures that the `sp` is below the allocation. In case of a
misalignment of 2 or 4 bytes, this is not the case, one gets a `SIGSEGV`.
In case of a misalignment of 6 bytes, it works again.
```
./stktst d '1024' -c '   2' -o '   0'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177200 (0,  5,64);
  # stktst-I: after  sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177200 (0,  5,64); 157200 (1,  5,64);
./stktst d '1024' -c '   2' -o '  -2'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177176 (0,  6, 2);
  # Segmentation fault (core dumped)
./stktst d '1024' -c '   2' -o '  -4'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177174 (0,  6, 4);
  # Segmentation fault (core dumped)
./stktst d '1024' -c '   2' -o '  -6'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177172 (0,  6, 6);
  # stktst-I: after  sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177172 (0,  6, 6); 157172 (1,  6, 6);
```
With some trial and error one can determine the situation where it fails:
```
./stktst d ' 151' -c '   2' -o '  -2'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177176 (0,  6, 2);
  # stktst-I: after  sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177176 (0,  6, 2); 174706 (0, 24,58);
./stktst d ' 152' -c '   2' -o '  -2'
  # stktst-I: before sp 177304 (0,  4,60); 177176 (0,  6, 2);
  # Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
That's after 25 clicks. The initial stack size is 20 clicks
(see [SSIZE](https://www.retro11.de/ouxr/211bsd/usr/src/sys/pdp/machparam.h.html#m:SSIZE)) and the stack segment is a bit larger to accommodate argument and
environment structures.
So the `double` pushes fail when the initial allocation is exhausted.
