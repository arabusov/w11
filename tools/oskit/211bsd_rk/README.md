## Notes on oskit: 2.11BSD system on RK05 volumes

### General remarks
See notes on
- [I/O emulation setup](../../../doc/w11a_io_emulation.md)
- [FPGA Board setup](../../../doc/w11a_board_connection.md)
- [Rlink and Backend Server setup](../../../doc/w11a_backend_setup.md)
- [SimH simulator setup](../../../doc/w11a_simh_setup.md)
- [e11 simulator setup](../../../doc/w11a_e11_setup.md)
- [Legal terms](../../../doc/w11a_os_guide.md)

### System properties and intended usage
- patch level is #447 plus [fpsim+tcsh patch](https://wfjm.github.io/blogs/211bsd/2017-06-06-kernel-panic-here-doc-tcsh.html)
- for history see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- **absolute minimal** system !! Not for practical use !!
- was useful at a time when w11a had only RK11 type disk support
- `/tmp` stays on '/'
- `/home` is not mounted
- suitable for a 'root' user, other accounts not supported

### Installation
A disk set is available from
http://www.retro11.de/data/oc_w11/oskits/211bsd_rkset.tgz

Download, unpack and copy the disk images (*.dsk), e.g.
```bash
    cd $RETROBASE/tools/oskit/211bsd_rk/
    211bsd_rk_setup
```

### Usage

- Start backend server and boot system (see section Rlink in
  [w11a_os_guide](../../../doc/w11a_os_guide.md#user-content-rlink))
  ```
       boot script:  211bsd_rk_boot.tcl
       example:      ti_w11 <opt> @211bsd_rk_boot.tcl
                     where <opt> is the proper option set for the board.
  ```
  or use for verification the SimH simulator  (see section SimH in
  [w11a_os_guide](../../../doc/w11a_os_guide.md#user-content-simh))
  ```
  pdp11 211bsd_rk_boot.scmd
  ```

- Hit `<ENTER>` in the `xterm` window to connnect to backend server.
  The boot dialog in the console `xterm` window will look like
  (required input is in `{..}`, with `{<CR>}` denoting a carriage return:
  ```
       70Boot from rk(0,0,0) at 0177404
       : {<CR>}
       : rk(0,0,0)unix
       Boot: bootdev=03000 bootcsr=0177404

       erase, kill ^U, intr ^C
  ```

  In first `'#'` prompt the system is in single-user mode. Just enter a `^D` 
  to continue the system startup to multi-user mode:
  ```
       #^D
       Fast boot ... skipping disk checks
       checking quotas: done.
       Assuming non-networking system ...
       checking for core dump... 
       preserving editor files
       clearing /tmp
       standard daemons: update cron accounting.

       2.11 BSD UNIX (w11a) (console)
       
       login: 
  ```

  The login prompt is sometimes mangled with system messages, if its not
  visible just hit `<ENTER>` to get a fresh one.
  ```
       login: {root}
       erase, kill ^U, intr ^C
  ```

  Now the system is in multi-user mode, daemons runnng. You can explore
  the system, e.g. with a `pstat -T` or a `mount` command. The second
  `xterm` can be activated too, it will connect to a second emulated DL11.
  At the end is important to shutdown properly with a `halt`:
  ```
       # {pstat -T}
        10/186 files
        44/208 inodes
        10/150 processes
         7/ 46 texts active,  30 used
         2/135 swapmap entries,  496 kB used, 1939 kB free, 1933 kB max
        35/150 coremap entries, 2828 kB free, 2744 kB max
         1/ 10  ub_map entries,   10    free,   10    max
       # {mount}
       /dev/rk0h on /
       /dev/rk2h on /tmp
       /dev/rk3h on /bin
       /dev/rk4h on /usr
       # {halt}
       syncing disks... done
       halting
  ```

  While the system was running the server process display the
  ```
       cpu0> 
  ```

  prompt. When the w11 has halted after 211bsd shutdown a message like
  ```
       CPU down attention
       Processor registers and status:
         PS: 030350 cm,pm=k,u s,p,t=0,7,0 NZVC=1000  rust: 01 HALTed
           R0: 177560  R1: 161322  R2: 053436  R3: 000010
           R4: 003000  R5: 147510  SP: 147466  PC: 000014
   ```

  will be visible. Now the server process can be stopped with `^D`.
